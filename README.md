# Blinduino

Academic project developed for the Embedded Systems: Architecture university course.

### Installation

The image recognition component requires you to have Python 3 installed and some of its libraries, all downloadable using pip:

`pip install imageai`

and if you are using windows, also:

`pip install win32com`

Then, to execute, just run the "start.bat" on windows, or `python FirstPredictionMac` on mac.

NOTE: if you have both Python 2 AND Python 3 installed, you probably want to add a "3" at the end of every command:

`pip3 install imageai`, `python3 FirstPredictionMac`

### TODO:
