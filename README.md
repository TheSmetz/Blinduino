# Blinduino

Academic project developed for the Embedded Systems: Architecture university course.

### Installation

The image recognition server (backend server) requires you to have Python 3 installed and some of its libraries, all downloadable using pip:

`pip install flask`
`pip install imageai`
`pip install tensorflow`

Then, to execute, just run `python ImageRecognitionServer.py` on windows, or `python ImageRecognitionServerMac.py` on mac.

NOTE: if you have both Python 2 AND Python 3 installed, you probably want to add a "3" at the end of every command:

`pip3 install flask`, `python3 FirstPredictionMac`
